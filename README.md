### Server

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) API running throught [Express](https://expressjs.com/) on `http://localhost:4000`.
The server hundles user's requests from the client, calls the database to retrieve some documents and make some processing on it before send back the result (example: parse images url to index them, sort images by score, etc...).
[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is use as ODM in this project.

### Client

[Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/) frontend including [vuex](https://next.vuex.vuejs.org/) as data store, [vue router](https://next.router.vuejs.org/) as pages navigation router and [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) as css framework.
Requests to the server are serve with [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).
The client is running on `http://locahost:8080`.

### Database

[Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) database to store images and keywords data for both forward and inverted indexing.

### Data visualization UI

[Mongo-express](https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express) is use for data visualization UI, it is available on `http://localhost:8081`.

## Project features

- Index 100 images store in an array of urls available in `./server/src/util/image-urls.js`, the script automatically parse each urls and store them into the database. It also generate all keywords data for inverted indexing, these scripts are available in `./server/src/util/fn-util.js`.
